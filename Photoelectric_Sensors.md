Photoelectric sensors are usually used for line tracking. To more accurately track a line, three of them are usually used. In 2011, they were used to track lines that led to the bars to mount tubes on.

Checkout the RoboLancers Google Drive folder for more documentation on the photoelectric sensors, including a datasheet and a tutorial on line tracking.

I wanna highlight that the tutorial recommends connecting the wires that receive power on the photoelectric sensor to the solenoid breakout so it receives a constant 24V source, assuming the solenoid module is plugged into the 24V source on the power board.
